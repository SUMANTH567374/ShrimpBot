After a disease outbreak, apply 100ppm chlorine for 30 minutes. Ensure tanks are rinsed and dried before refilling.


Maintain water pH between 7.8 and 8.3. If pH drops below 7.5, use lime to correct. Keep ammonia levels below 0.5 ppm.


Reduce feeding rate by 20% if shrimp survival drops below 70%. Observe shrimp behavior twice daily for adjustments.


Maintain optimal water temperature between 27°C and 30°C. Gradually adjust if needed, avoiding rapid fluctuations.


Isolate affected tanks immediately. Use probiotics and maintain biosecurity protocols. Increase aeration during outbreaks.
